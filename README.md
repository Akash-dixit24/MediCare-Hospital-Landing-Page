🔧 Work Done – Step-by-Step
1. Folder and File Setup
Project created using Vite + React

Folder structure:

css
Copy
Edit
src/
  ├─ components/
  ├─ assets/
  ├─ styles/
  ├─ App.jsx
  └─ main.jsx
2. Component-Based Design
Each UI section is a React component:

Component	Description
Header.jsx	Sticky Navbar with smooth-scroll links
Hero.jsx	Hero banner with heading, description, and two CTA buttons
Services.jsx	Dynamic services cards with hover animation
Innovation.jsx	Card-based layout showing clinic features
Doctors.jsx	Doctor cards with images fetched using Axios
Reviews.jsx	Testimonials section with patient reviews
Newsletter.jsx	Email subscription form
Footer.jsx	Social links and copyright

3. Smooth Scroll Navbar
Header.jsx contains links like #home, #about, #services, #news, etc.

Each target section (Hero, Innovation, Services, Newsletter) was given a unique id:

Component	Section ID
Hero	home
Innovation	about
Services	services
Newsletter	news
Doctors	departments

CSS added in responsive.css or index.css:

css
Copy
Edit
html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}
4. Responsive Design
Custom responsive styling placed in src/styles/responsive.css

Used Tailwind’s responsive utilities (md:, sm:) for layout adjustments

Media queries in responsive.css for fine control on mobile layout, e.g.:

css
Copy
Edit
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .hero-text h1 { font-size: 2.5rem; }
  .newsletter-box { flex-direction: column; }
}
5. Dynamic Services Section
Data loaded from services.json

Icons like FaTooth, FaBrain, etc. dynamically rendered using a map

Animated hover effects with blur overlays using Tailwind’s group classes

6. Doctors Section via Axios
Axios fetched images from:

bash
Copy
Edit
https://admin.tomedes.com/api/v1/get-reviews?page=1
The image data was mapped onto static doctor names/specialties

Only 4 images were used (via .slice(0, 4))

7. Newsletter Form
Styled form for email input and CTA button

Fully responsive using flex and padding utilities

Wrapped in a blue background card to highlight the section

8. Footer with Social Icons
Uses FaFacebookF, FaGoogle, and FaTwitter icons

Icons are styled inside white circular buttons with hover zoom effect

9. Deployment-Ready
App is ready for production deployment via Vercel

Fast loading due to Vite + optimized CSS
